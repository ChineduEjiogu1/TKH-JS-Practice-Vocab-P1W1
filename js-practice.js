//Complete the instructions for each numbered problem. Each numbered problem is worth 10 points

//1. data types built-in methods, variables

//a. define a variable and give it a string value
let var1 = "Good morning";
//b. define a variable and give it a number value
let var2 = 5;
//c. define a variable and give it a boolean value
let var3 = true;

//2. if else, ternary

//a. define a variable 'metrocard' and give it a value of 5
let metrocard = 5;
//b. write an if statement that has a condition to check if the value of metro card is greater than 2.75, and display the message "you have enough to ride the train", if the condition is true

//c.write an else statement that displays the message "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry"

if(metrocard > 2.75)
{
    console.log("you have enough to ride the train");
}else{
    console.log("you do not have enough to pay fare sorry");
}

//d. write the above if/else statement again as a ternary

console.log(metrocard > 2.75 ? "you have enough to ride the train" : "you do not have enough to pay fare sorry");

//3. conditionals 2 (1 pt)
//a.  complete this codecademy project: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/magic-eight-ball-1
//add a screenshot showing your completion of this project to the root folder of this repo

//4. functions
//a. write a function named helloWorld that returns the value 'Hello World!'

function helloWorld()
{
    return "Hello World!";
}

//b. console log the value returned from running the function helloWorld

console.log(helloWorld());

//3. arrays
//a. define a variable myArray and assign it to a value of an array. Give the array at least 5 elements
const myArray = ["Apple", "Grapes", "Banana", "Tangerine", "Cantaloupe"];
//b. an array's index starts at: 0
//

console.log(myArray[0]);
0


//4. loops

//a. write a for loop that console logs even numbers starting at 10 and decrementing to 0

for(let countdown = 10; countdown >= 0; countdown-=2){
    console.log(countdown);
}

//5. objects

//a. define a variable named 'bike'

//b. assign an object to bike

//c. give the object 3 properties: handlebars, color, wheels

//d. give each property a value

let bike = new Object();

bike.handlebars = "Cruiser Bars"; 
bike.color = "Red";
bike.wheels = "Mid section wheels";


//6. Chessboard
/*Write a function that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8. 
**You do not need to accept user input this differs from Eloquent JS's directions 

read and refer to https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html  there are hints at the bottom of the page 
*/

function chessboard(size = 8, chessboard = "")
{

    for(let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        for(let j = 0; j < size; j++) {
           if( (i + j) % 2 === 0)
           {
             chessboard += " ";
           }else{
             chessboard += "#";
           }
        }
        chessboard += "\n";
    }

    console.log(chessboard)
}

console.log(chessboard());
